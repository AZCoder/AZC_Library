# AZC Library
 Arma 3 Function Library for Single-Player

I started creating these functions for Shadow Fall in late 2015. As I near completion of of the 3rd and final campaign Dark Tides, I feel that these functions have become mature enough to plop into an addon.

The library will initialize these values:
AZC_Debug = false;
- setting this true (IN your mission) will cause some functions to output test data on the screen
AZC_libInit = true;
- this is leftover from the Arma 2 era, not really needed now but can be used to verify that the library is loaded
